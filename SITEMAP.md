### UI Experience Notes
*   **Sticky Header**: High-end navigation with the "Donate" button always accessible.
*   **Scroll Reveal**: Text and images should slide into view gracefully as the user scrolls.
*   **Cream Aesthetics**: Use of white space and subtle shadows to maintain the professional, clean look.
